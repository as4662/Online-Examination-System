# Online-Examination-System
An online examination system is a web-based platform that enables students to
take tests and exams via the internet. This system is designed to provide a secure
and convenient testing environment for students, while also making it easier for
educators to administer and grade exams. Online examination systems typically
consist of a user interface for students to access exams and answer questions, and
an administrative interface for educators to create, manage, and grade exams.
Students can log into the system using their unique login credentials and access
exams that have been assigned to them. This system can also be designed to
include features such as time limits, randomization of questions, and the ability
to save and review answers. The benefits of an online examination system include
increased accessibility, as students can take exams from any location with internet
access, reduced administrative workload for educators, and improved accuracy
and speed of grading.
